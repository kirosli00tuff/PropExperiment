# Locked decisions

- Venue: Topstep via TopstepX/ProjectX API. Rationale: only futures prop
  firm with native REST/WebSocket API; Tradovate blocks API on prop
  accounts; Apex bans automation outright.
- Scope: XFA only, current phase. LFA is a call-up exit event, modeled as
  terminal in the funnel simulator, not solved for.
- Instrument ranking: MES > MNQ > MGC > MCL, on cost-to-range and data
  quality. Micros required for $2,000 trailing MLL granularity (10:1
  ratio, 50-micro cap on 50K).
- Data: Databento GLBX.MDP3 for all backtest history. TopstepX
  retrieveBars for live/streaming and cross-checks only (shallow history
  on expired contracts, gateway limitation).
- Execution/rules-engine design borrows the shape of two existing repos:
  HFExperiment's intent/gate pattern (frozen Intent dataclass, pure
  check_order function, named refusals in fixed order) and AiTrader's
  RiskGate/kill-switch pattern (final-authority deny-only gate, JSON
  kill-request file, manual resume required). Adapted to Topstep's rules,
  not left generic.
- No sandbox exists on TopstepX. All early testing runs on a Practice
  account against live endpoints.
- Orchestration (2026-09-21): stage sessions run a Fable lead that plans,
  routes, verifies and synthesizes, with workers on haiku (pure extraction
  only), sonnet, opus or fable at medium, high, xhigh or max effort. No low
  effort. Concurrency capped at 4. Rules in
  CLAUDE.md, rationale and the stage-prompt template in docs/ORCHESTRATION.md.
